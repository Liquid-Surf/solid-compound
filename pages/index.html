    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Solid Compound is an innovative library designed to streamline the integration of web applications into the Solid
      ecosystem. It provides functionality to Solid App developers to make their Solid Apps be usable without end-users
      needing a Solid Pod or a WebID. This lowers the barrier of entry for new end-users and allows everyone to use newly
      crafted and innovative Solid applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solid Compound offers a hybrid data storage approach, allowing for data to be stored either in the application's
      datastore (but Solid-ready) or in the user's Solid pod. It also enables user authentication either done by the
      application or Solid-OIDC. This merging of traditional web development with Solid-compatible systems also extends the
      functionality to include a feature that enables data and identity migration from an application's datastore to a user's
      pod when they are ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hybrid approach ensures a smooth transition towards a more decentralized web while simultaneously broadening the
      reach of Solid developers to users who may not yet be familiar with the Solid ecosystem.

    <h3>Project Details</h3>
    <p>
      Solid Compound is a software library/framework for the Solid ecosystem that allows developers to easily build web
      applications compatible with the Solid specification while also offering the flexibility to use the applications in a
      "traditional" way, where the application authenticates users and stores their data.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Solid Compound, developers can build web applications that have the capabilities to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store data locally in the app's own storage or in the user's Solid Pod</li>
      <li>Authenticate users using credentials (email address/password) stored with the app or allow authentication with
        Solid-OIDC</li>
      <li>Keep data securely in the app's storage or migrate data at a later stage to a Solid Pod</li>
      <li>Use an existing Solid Pod or create a Solid Pod for the user with one of the existing Pod providers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By combining and improving existing efforts within the Solid ecosystem, we aim to provide an approachable tool that
      simplifies the development process for both users and developers, thereby contributing to the adoption of Solid.

    <h3>Team Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name: Theo Meyer</li>
      <li>Email: theomeyer@domain.com</li>
      <li>Name: Jan Schill</li>
      <li>Email: janschill@domain.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We have previous experience working on Solid-related projects and have contributed to the community in various ways.
      Jan has built Solid components integrated with CERN's web applications and developed a Solid App store for promoting
      Solid Apps. Theo has focused on the Community Solid Server (CSS) and built CSS components. Our previous projects, such
      as Solidapp.store and liquid.surf, can benefit from a framework like Solid Compound.

    <h3>Project Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>
      The Solid specification is still evolving, and we will actively engage with the Solid community to contribute our
      findings and provide feedback. We will also leverage existing open source projects and build upon them to benefit the
      broader open source community. Testing the library in real-life applications will help uncover new edge cases that can
      be reported back to the Solid community, furthering the development of the ecosystem.
